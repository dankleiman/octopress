    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It happened again.</p>

<p>At 5:00am this morning I woke myself up&hellip;.talking through a solution to a coding problem I had at the end of the day yesterday.</p>

<p>I was literally coding in my sleep.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="http://dankleiman.github.io/blog/2014/05/17/launch-academy-week-1-reflections/">Tetris Effect</a>? It&rsquo;s in full effect.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve seen this before and once I got over the shock of writing code in my sleep, I got pretty excited. It means some serious learning is going on.</p>

<h2>Intensive Learning and Brain Cycles</h2>

<p>In 2004, I attended my first qigong (pronounce &ldquo;chee-gung,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s the Chinese practice of developing your natural internal energy. You can read more about my background in this practice <a href="http://dankleiman.com">here</a>) instructor training.</p>

<p>We trained 8-10 hours a day and we were about 10 days in before we got a day off.</p>

<p>It was July in Northern California and we decided to escape the heat by going to see a movie.</p>

<p>I rememember sitting in the theatre and looking down at my hands. They were pulsing in and out, getting bigger and smaller&hellip;.and I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything.</p>

<p>I should tell you that the main practice we were working on, called &ldquo;Opening and Closing&rdquo; involves manipulating the synovial fluids of the joints and the ligaments so that the joint spaces shrink and expand in a rhythm&hellip;but we do it under direct, conscious control.</p>

<p>Sitting in the theatre, I was zoning out to Spider Man or some other summer blockbuster. In my tuned-out state, my body was going all by itself.</p>

<p>Strange. Alien. And, as I later learned, a totally natural way to process new input, whether it&rsquo;s physical or mental.</p>

<p>Our nervous systems need time to process new information and integrate it. <strong>It turns out that this kind of integration is best done unconscously.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve been experiencing less extreme examples too. Every time you get up, step away from the computer, and do a different activity, you give your unconscious mind a chance to catch up and process.</p>

<p>So, bathroom trips, conversations in the kitchen, a run down the stairs and out onto the street &mdash; all these activities, or <em>un-activities</em> create an opportunity for passive processing.</p>

<p>My goal is to keep up, as strange as it sounds, deliberate un-deliberate times to maximize learning and work, because the truth is, these things are circular &mdash; rest completes work &mdash; not linear.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written about how this works from a Tai Chi perspective too, <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/04/23/practice-rhythms-at-tai-chi-immersion-week/">if you&rsquo;re curious to read more</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://dankleiman.github.io/blog/2014/05/17/launch-academy-week-1-reflections/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-17T09:32:59-04:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, all this week, I&rsquo;ve been experiencing the Tetris effect and I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate the beauty, and the painlessness, of learning how to break down a problem.</p>

<p>Let me explain&hellip;.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Tetris Effect</h2>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tetris-dreams/">the study from Harvard Medical School</a>, games like Tetris can reveal the way our brain integrates new information.</p>

<blockquote>In fact, the game Tetris has proved to be just that. Robert Stickgold and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School recently conducted a clever set of experiments in which they used the game to guide the content of peopleÂ¿s dreams: among 17 subjects they trained to play Tetris, more than 60 percent reported dreaming of images associated with the game. </blockquote>


<p>I&rsquo;ve been having similar dreams about coding all week, especially as I&rsquo;m falling asleep.</p>

<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve had to resist the urge to jump out of bed and grab my laptop to finish coding problems that plagued me during the day.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s so cool is that my instructors at Launch Academy have been talking from the beginning about the way coding &mdash; and more generally the brain &mdash; works. They&rsquo;ve been extremely clear about the value of stepping away from the computer to actually find the solution.</p>

<p>I love being immersed in this environment where the answers to &ldquo;my work&rdquo; pour in at night, or on breaks, and more importantly, these down moments are treated as equally valuable as work time.</p>

<h2>Shoring Up Fundamentals</h2>

<p>All week, we&rsquo;ve been reviewing pre-work and solidifying our Ruby basics.</p>

<p>Specifically, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been covering:</p>

<p><em>Ruby fundamentals
</em>Hashes, arrays, and compound data structures
<em>Iteration
</em>File IO</p>

<p>Launch Academy has some pretty cool custom tools to help us do this work. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen things like CodeAcademy or RubyMonk.</p>

<p>At Launch Academy, we have internal tools that integrate shell commands to download, test, and submit practice problems. What I love about this is that not only are we honing our Ruby fundamentals, but we&rsquo;re integrating other skills, like command line basics, git, and a broader understanding of how to navigate the file system.</p>

<p>Next week, I think we&rsquo;re going to expand this work to include remote repositories.</p>

<p>Even though it&rsquo;s been a few days, it feels like it&rsquo;s been months of immersion and I can&rsquo;t wait to get back to work on Monday!</p>

    <link href="http://dankleiman.github.io/blog/2014/05/09/this-is-new-post/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-09T12:18:25-04:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Preparing for <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com">Launch Academy</a>
while finishing up work as the director <a href="http://www.brooklinetaichi.org">Brookline Tai Chi</a> has been a massive exercise in balancing &ldquo;theory and practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This explanation from Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz perfectly captures the difference:</p>

<!-- more -->




<blockquote>What is the difference between theory and practice?
In theory, there is none. If theory were practice you could learn the rules of OOD, apply them consistently, and create perfect code from this day forward; your work here would be done.

However, no matter how deeply theory believes this to be true, practice knows better. Unlike theory, practice gets its hands dirty. It is practice that lays bricks, builds bridges, and writes code. Practice lives in the real world of change, confusion, and uncertainty.</blockquote>


<p>I&rsquo;ve been straddling the worlds of theory and practice for months now.</p>

<p><strong>Learning to Code <em>in Theory</em></strong></p>

<p>Every book, online tutorial, and exercise that I&rsquo;ve been working on, in Ruby, HTML, CSS, MySQL, has been carefully selected by the instructors at Launch Academy to lead us step-by-step through the basics.</p>

<p>The examples are clean.</p>

<p>Instructions are clear.</p>

<p>And when we get stuck, we can reach out for help and clarification.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pleasure to live in this world</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Tai Chi <em>in Practice</em></strong></p>

<p>For the last ten years, I&rsquo;ve been teaching Tai Chi, working with students who are brand new to the practice or who are gradually building new skills.</p>

<p>Early on, I learned from my teaching mentor that you should only ever teach material that is well integrated into your own body, so that you can model it clearly, cleanly, and on demand.</p>

<p>The process of translating Tai Chi theory, embodied principles, and new concepts to something that students can absorb is an exercise in moving from the clean world of theory to the messy realm of practice.</p>

<p>How will they interpret a lesson?</p>

<p>What else are they thinking about when they come to class at night?</p>

<p>Is there something they&rsquo;d rather do with their time?</p>

<p>How do we handle layers of old injuries?</p>

<p>Being on the other side of the theory and practice dichotomy has its own rewards, <a href="http://dankleiman.com/about/">which I&rsquo;ve written about here</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, though, I&rsquo;m enjoying being in both worlds simultaneously. I can appreciate all the work the staff at Launch Academy has done to present us with clean, clear instructions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also getting a little space from my own teaching, so I can appreciate the more abstract, theoretical questions of how, why, and what should be taught, unencumbered by a lot of practical constraints.</p>

<p><strong>Balancing Theory and Practice in the Future</strong></p>

<p>Going forward, months from now, when I&rsquo;m fully immersed in the world of web applications and my day-to-day will lean more to the &ldquo;practice&rdquo; end of the balance than the &ldquo;theory&rdquo; side, I hope I can remember this feeling of blending both worldviews.</p>

<p>By creating space to find a clean &ldquo;theory&rdquo; mindset, you really do get more energy to implement the realities of &ldquo;practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time, the craftmanship of practice motivates you to explore and refine theory.</p>

<p>If I can find the right balance, work life will be even more rewarding!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;I just want to get a feel for what I can change/do&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to see what I could do&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the middle of launching this blog, I wanted to change some of the core settings and I wasn&rsquo;t sure what could safely be changed without breaking the whole thing.</p>

<p>When I asked someone for help, I explained that I wanted to &ldquo;get a feel&rdquo; for what I could do without messing other things up.</p>

<h2>How Would You Have Phrased That?</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t used to make a big distinction between these two ways of phrasing, but as I&rsquo;m reading <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning by Andy Hunt</a>, I&rsquo;m starting to become much more acutely aware of all these layers of filters, perspectives, and contexts that we each have for experiencing the world that influence what we see, say, and do.</p>

<p>For instance, what you value and how you communicate may be shaped by:
&ndash; your personality type, notably your degree of introversion or extroversion (I love thinking of this as &ldquo;how you recharge your batteries &mdash; from the inside or from other people&rdquo;)
&ndash; the generation you were born, even in the sense of how you see the role of institutions/companies that you interact with (need to read up on this more, but some people have theorized that there are only 4 generational archetypes that repeat over and over again, largely created and re-created in reference to the previous generation)
&ndash; the primary senses you use to take information in (often described in an educational context as learning style, i.e. visual, auditory, or kinesthetic)</p>

<h2>Starting to Notice Filters and Cues</h2>

<p>After reading the chapter on sensory filters, I spent the day trying to pick up on subtle language cues that people dropped as I talked to them.</p>

<p>Specificially, I was <a href="http://dankleiman.com">teaching Tai Chi lessons</a> that day, so once I heard a clear cue (&ldquo;I see what you&rsquo;re saying&hellip;&rdquo;), I tried to adapt the teaching to cater to that style.</p>

<p>My first attempt was too heavy-handed, though, and it just ended up confusing my student.</p>

<p>Fascinating to keep trying this approach, though!</p>

<h2>Writing This Post in Markdown</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m learning how to write this in <a href="http://http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">Markdown</a> which is also pretty new to me. Right now it feels like a lazy version of html, so we&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s it like as I get used to it.</p>
