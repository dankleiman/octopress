We're helping companies get their drugs to people who need them faster and more efficiently by bringing technology solutions to clinical trials.

We have a nice, big, 7-year-old-and-growing Rails app. I'm always discovering new features and fun little code corners to explore.

More About My Background
------------------------

I am a recent graduate of [Launch Academy](http://launchacademy.com) in Boston. You'll find posts in the archives all about my experiences learning at Launch (it was life-changing!).

Prior to Launch Academy, I ran [Brookline Tai Chi](http://brooklinetaichi.org) for almost 10 years. I taught adults how to relax, slowdown, and improve their health with the Chinese movement arts of Tai Chi and qigong. In addition to being on of the lead instructors, I managed the school and the larger 501(c)(3) non-profit that runs the school.

Over the last 4 years, I expanded our [Tai Chi for Healthy Aging](http://brooklinetaichi.org/what-we-teach/tai-chi-for-healthy-aging/) program to bring Tai Chi to hundreds of seniors throughout Massachusetts. With funding from the [Tufts Health Plan Foundation](http://www.tuftshealthplanfoundation.org/) and the Department of Public Health and a close working partnership with the [Massachusetts Falls Prevention Coalition](http://www.maseniorcarefoundation.org/Initiatives/Falls_Prevention/Massachusetts_Falls_Prevention_Coalition.aspx), we've been able to train volunteer instructors in an evidence-based falls prevention program that is taught in Senior Centers, Councils on Aging, and other community settings.
