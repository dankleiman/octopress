{% img left http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/DK_Headshot.jpg [Dan Kleiman [Dan Kleiman]] %} I'm currently a Ruby on Rails Apprentice at [Launch Academy](http://launchacademy.com) in Boston.

If you're reading this in the Spring/Summer of 2014, then a lot of the current blog posts will be chronicling my learning journey.

Prior to Launch Academy, I ran [Brookline Tai Chi](http://brooklinetaichi.org) for almost 10 years. I taught adults how to relax, slowdown, and improve their health with the Chinese movement arts of Tai Chi and qigong. In addition to being on of the lead instructors, I managed the school and the larger 501(c)(3) non-profit that runs the school.

Over the last 4 years, I expanded our [Tai Chi for Healthy Aging](http://brooklinetaichi.org/what-we-teach/tai-chi-for-healthy-aging/) program to bring Tai Chi to hundreds of seniors throughout Massachusetts. With funding from the [Tufts Health Plan Foundation](http://www.tuftshealthplanfoundation.org/) and the Department of Public Health and a close working partnership with the [Massachusetts Falls Prevention Coalition](http://www.maseniorcarefoundation.org/Initiatives/Falls_Prevention/Massachusetts_Falls_Prevention_Coalition.aspx), we've been able to train volunteer instructors in an evidence-based falls prevention program that is taught in Senior Centers, Councils on Aging, and other community settings.

Why Code Now?
-------------

One of my favorite parts of teaching at Brookline Tai Chi was my own ongoing learning.

Very early on, I figured out that if I didn't keep up my own personal practice, where I was trying and learning new things, separate and distinct from what I was teaching, I got burnt out, the classes had less energy, and students were more confused and frustrated.

It took me a while to come to terms with the seemingly selfish nature of this lesson, but eventually I accepted: **when I'm learning, I do better work and have more to share.**

In 2010, while I was teaching 15-20 hours a week of live classes, I decided to refine this learning/teaching/sharing loop even more by beginning to teach via [DanKleiman.com](http://dankleiman.com).

By blogging, making instructional videos and podcasting, I was able to refine my teaching, reach a much wider audience, and experiment with new media, like guided audio practice.

But there was a problem....

I kept bumping into technical limitations. With each new technical challenge I got more and more curious about the online tools I was using:

 - creating the right front-end look for my site
 - generating my weekly email from the site RSS automatically
 - hosting private forums and downloads for certain students
 - capturing customer data from email, payment providers, and site analytics

 Increasingly, I thought, *if I could just build this myself* or *if I could patch this together with that.*

Validation from Confusion
--------------------------

I started telling friends about the little things I fantasized about building, like a business app that would replace the need to email spreadsheets back and forth....and the confused looks I got back were major validation.

**In the gulf between my excitement and their reaction, I saw a new career emerging.**

The more I did online coding tutorials, the more interested I got in the way information is structured, moved, displayed, and consumed.

Knowing the [power of immersive learning](http://dankleiman.com/tag/wsfit2011/), I started to consider coding bootcamps like Launch Academy as a way to really expand my skills.

Finally, in December 2013, I made the decision to go for. I applied, got in, and here we are. This next step in my professional journey is likely what you'll read about on this site.

I hope to keep learning and sharing as I go.

Thanks for coming along!
