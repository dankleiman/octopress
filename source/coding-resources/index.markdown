These are resources I've come across that have helped me launch this site and learn to code.

Based on [Hunt's Pragmatic Thinking & Learning](http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning), I'm trying to create an "exocortex" to help free up mental space.

Octopress Blogging

Soaking Up Code Talk
--------------------

When I've learned new languages in the past, I've always tried to surround myself with as much natural, idomatic speech as possible, like watching TV or movies or even better going places. So here are a few ways I've tried to soak up coding language.

- [Boston Ruby Group](http://bostonrb.org) -- project nights and presentations are great for trying to understand new things and see what you already kind of get.
- [Thoughtbot Podcast](http://podcasts.thoughtbot.com/giantrobots/90) -- I just listened to this episode on creating a git shell command line tool to simplify using git commands. The basic idea was right at the intersection of several things I had been working on, so it was a cool way to integrate and validate and at the same time, clue me in to some new possibilities. In general, this podcast is a cool mix of technical discussion I pretty much understand and broader themes.
