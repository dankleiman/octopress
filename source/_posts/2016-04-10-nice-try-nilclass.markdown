I love that feeling when a new concept starts to come together in your mind and you can point to all the converging sources of insight.

Right now, I can't tell if I'm fooling myself, hiding some logic, or making my code more readable with this particular concept, but when I put together these three pieces of information, I think I start to see something emerge.
<!-- more -->

I've been inspired to do some more digging into these kinds of questions lately thanks to the awesome new [Ruby Book Club Podcast](http://rubybookclub.com/). Co-hosts [Nadia Odunayo](http://twitter.com/nodunayo) and [Saron Yitbarek](http://twitter.com/saronyitbarek) are leading us chapter-by-chapter through different Ruby books and sharing their thoughts on the podcast as they go.

This week, specifically, I came across:

 - Damir Svrtan's article about [whitelisting input with #presence_in in Rails](https://infinum.co/the-capsized-eight/articles/whitelisting-with-the-lesser-known-presence-in-method).
 - [Avdi Grimm's Confident Ruby](http://www.confidentruby.com/) where #fetch is used to pull data out of hash.
 - A work situation, we were cleaning up #present? checks on incoming params input using #presence

I still don't know exactly what to call this collection of methods, but they all feel very related to me. They all remind me of [#try](http://apidock.com/rails/v4.2.1/Object/try), which makes me nervous.

Using #try always feels like a little bit of a crutch, where you don't quite know what inputs you are expecting or haven't coded thoroughly to all your cases, but in Rails, #try swallows some of the errors you would have run into and returns nil instead.

With these three methods, we're doing something similar. In each case, we get a simple way to check for a value and handle missing values gracefully with defaults, moving forward if the value is present.

So, for #presence, instead of:

```ruby

params[:name].blank? ? params[:name] : nil

```
We can do:


```ruby

params[:name].presence

```

 For whitelisting, instead of:


```ruby

if params[:name].present? && %w(foo bar).include?(params[:name])
  params[:name]
else
  nil
end

```

We can use #presence_in like this:

```ruby

params[:name].presence_in %w(foo bar)

```

Finally, with #fetch, the only Ruby standard library method in this group (the rest come from Rails), you have a few different options. Lifted straight from [the docs](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html#method-i-fetch):

```ruby

h = { "a" => 100, "b" => 200 }
h.fetch("a")                            #=> 100
h.fetch("z", "go fish")                 #=> "go fish"
h.fetch("z") { |el| "go fish, #{el}"}   #=> "go fish, z"

```

With #fetch, you use a key to puull a value from the hash, but you now you can define a default as your second argument, which is used to rescue missing key errors. Even better, you can execute whole block in the case that your key is not there.

I went digging a little more because I was still feeling uneasy about #try, but I couldn't quite articulate why. Guess who I found to say it for me? [Here's Avdi from 2011 on Structural Coupling enabled by #try](http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/07/05/demeter-its-not-just-a-good-idea-its-the-law/):

<blockquote>
<p>The seed of this all-too-common predicament is structural coupling. What’s structural coupling? To
define it, let’s start with a review of the DRY principle:</p>

<blockquote>"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within the system."</blockquote>

<p>It’s easy to think about DRYness just in terms of data: e.g., there should be only one place in the
system for API keys; they shouldn’t just be copy-and-pasted willy-nilly throughout the codebase. But
DRY applies equally to structural knowledge: knowledge about the composition of and relationships
between your objects.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the code we started out with:</p>

```ruby
def user_info(user)
  "Name: #{user.name}. Dept: #{user.department.try(:name)}"
end

```

<p>This seemingly innocuous code makes the following assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>user will have a name property.</li>
  <li>user may or may not have a single department.</li>
  <li>user's department, in turn, has a name property</li>
</ul>


<p>By going two levels deep into user's associations, we’ve made a structural coupling between this code and the models it works with. We’ve duplicated knowledge about a User’s associations—canonically located in the User and Department classes—in the #user_info method.</p>

<p>And the #try method was an enabler. By papering over the ugly user.department && user.department.name construct we’d otherwise have had to use, #try made the coupling an easier syntactical pill to swallow.</p>
</blockquote>

I highly recommend you read the whole article, as he goes into how this coupling violates the Law of Demeter and links back to [an earlier discussion of #try](http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/06/28/do-or-do-not-there-is-no-try/), because, clearly, while these types of methods are cool and convenient, they make him a little uneasy too.
