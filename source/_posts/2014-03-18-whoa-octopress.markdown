So, I just launched this new blog using Octopress.

Here are the steps I followed:

* [Basics](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/)
* [How to Blog](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/)
* [Deploying on Github](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/)

I need to dig into the [configuration stuff](http://octopress.org/docs/configuring/) a little more.

Writing This Post in Markdown
-----------------------------

I'm learning how to write this in [Markdown](http://http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) which is also pretty new to me. Right now it feels like a lazy version of html, so we'll see what's it like as I get used to it.
