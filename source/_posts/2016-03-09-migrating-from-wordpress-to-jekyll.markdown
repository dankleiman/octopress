So, I've decided to migrate my [Tai Chi site at dankleiman.com](http://dankleiman.com) from Wordpress to a new static site using Jekyll.

Since I haven't posted there in almost two years, but I get a steady stream of new subscribers who want to learn about Tai Chi, qigong, and meditation, I thought it would be good to give the 300+ pages and posts a more evergreen feel.

The switch from Wordpress to Jekyll is exciting for me because:

- I get to learn a new framework that's in line with tools I use every day, like Ruby and git.
- I can deliver existing content to new users quickly and easily with plain html.
- The content on the site deserves a fresh coat of paint and likely some re-writing.

As I begin to play with the different components for the migration from Wordpress to Jekyll, it seems like the project will break down into the following areas:

1. [Migrating Posts and Pages](/blog/2016/03/11/migrating-posts-and-pages-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/)
2. Migrating Assets
3. Grooming/Revisiting Existing Content
4. Site Look and Feel
5. Handling Form Submission
6. DNS and Redirection

I plan to write about each of these areas and link to each topic as I publish more about the different decisions and steps that go into each part of the migration process.
