In the spring of 2014, I attended Launch Academy in Boston. Since then, I've moved into a career as a software developer. I love it and I'd love to hear from other Bootcamp alumni about their experiences going from Bootcamp to a career in technology.

<strong>I'm hoping to use this survery as a starting point about what it's like to take the "bootcamp path" to a technology career. What was it that attracted you to this approach to learning and working and how has that evolved since you attended a bootcamp? Hopefully, we can uncover some patterns in our shared experience and understand our own choices better as a result.</strong>

Just to be clear, I plan to collect many responses and try to make sense of them, but I won't share your information with anyone else. I do plan to write about the results on this site, but I will reach out to you to talk more about your answers before I do.

Thanks for taking the time to share your experience!
